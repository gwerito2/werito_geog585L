                        With the City of Albuquerque continuing to grow as a Bicycle friendly community,
						strides have been made to add or widen city streets for Bicycle lanes.
						As bicycle commuters find their way throughout the city streets to major
						Bicycle/ Pedestrian trails or lanes, most commuters have to place themselves
						in hazardous situations while riding with traffic. Ellison Dr NW,
						between Coors Bypass and Alameda Blvd NW (Hwy 528) is a good example
						of commuters placing themselves in this situation.
                     </p>

                     <p>
                        Bicycle lanes are available on Ellison Dr. but terminate at the intersection
						of Ellison Dr. and Coors Bypass and does not resume until the intersection
						of Ellison Dr and Alameda Blvd (Hwy 528). Bicycle commuters do have the right
						to ride on city streets, provided they follow the same rules that apply to
						motor vehicles. In this case, traffic can become very demanding during key
						commuting hours, enhancing hazardous conditions.
                     </p>
